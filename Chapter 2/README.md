# Chapter 2 Metrics Based Methods

In this chapter, we will explore MEtrics based methods for one shot learning
1. Siamese Network: we use twin network to compare similarities/discimilarities.
2. Matching Network

In this chapter, we will learn about deep learning architectures that can learn proper
mathematical representations from smaller datasets. Overall, we aim to create an
architecture that can generalize unfamiliar categories without extensive data collections or
training processes.

# Siamese networks â€“ the MNIST dataset
In this tutorial, we will do the following things in the order listed here:
1. Data preprocessing: Creating pairs
2. Creating a Siamese network architecture
3. Training it using the small MNIST dataset
4. Visualizing the embeddings
