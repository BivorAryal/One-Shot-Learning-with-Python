# kNN Basic one shot learning
    a. In this chapter we will compare kNN to neural network where we have small dataset. we will be using iris dataset import scikit-learn lib.
## 
    a. we predict our test dataset for both kNN and a neural network and compare the two.
    For our current scenario, we can see that the neural network is less accurate than the kNN.
This could be due to a lot of reasons, including the randomness of the dataset, the choice of
neighbors, and the number of layers. But if we run it enough times, we will observe that a
kNN is more likely to give a better output as it always stores data points, instead of
learning parameters as neural networks do. Therefore, a kNN can be called a one-shot
learning method.
### Summary
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of data science and it is still making progress,
but there are still major industries that are yet to experience all of the advantages of deep
learning, such as the medical and manufacturing industries. The zenith of human
achievement will be to create a machine that can learn as humans do and that can become
an expert in the same way humans can. Successful deep learning, though, usually comes
with the prerequisite of having very large datasets to work from. Fortunately, this book
focuses on architectures that can do away with this prerequisite.
In this chapter, we learned about the human brain and how the structure of an artificial
neural network is close to the structure of our brain. We introduced the basic concepts of
machine learning and deep learning, along with their challenges. We also discussed oneshot
learning and its various types, and later experimented with the iris dataset to
compare a parametric and nonparametric approach in a scarce data situation. Overall, we
concluded that proper feature representation plays an important role in determining the
efficiency of a machine learning model.
In the next chapter, we will learn about metrics-based one-shot learning methods and
explore the feature extraction domain of one-shot learning algorithms.
